# Step 1: Setup project
I am using pycharm
Here is my db schema
mysql+pymysql://****:****@localhost:3306/products_db
I want to make a FastAPI project for a simple feature voting system. Users can post features and upvote them.
Give me a good folder structure and files layout for best practices.
No auth is needed let make it easy and keep things simples with best practice folder and files

---

# Step 2: Models
Create  models:
- Feature: id, title, description, created_at
- Vote: id, feature_id (FK to Feature)
I need auto commit i don't want people to have to create those tables

---

# Step 3:  schemas
I want schemas for vote and feature that will be compatible with fastapi

---

# Step 4: CRUD functions
I need some basic CRUD functions for the project. For features:
create_feature
- get_features
- get_feature
And for votes:
- create_vote
- count_votes
I want them to return objects, just simple working functions.

---

# Step 5: Endpoints
Make FastAPI endpoints:
/api/features/ ET, POST
/api/votes/{feature_id} POST, GET
Include vote counts in responses

---

# Step 6: Front
I want to test from local HTML
i need to be able to create feature see all features and vote for feature

---

# Step 7:  Issues cors
Here is my issue i think it is because of cors

# Step 8: Verify everything
Make me a good read me file to explain that including all those steps

---

#Step 9: let create a test file to have unit tests in my project
I need a unique test file not too complex to keep it easy and do unit test over all my app
using pytest

---

#Step 10: issue with httpx
I can't install httpx for test
'c:\\users\\jonat\\pycharmprojects\\fastapiproject\\.venv\\lib\\site-packages\\httpx-1.0.dev2.dist-info

---

#Step 11: Read me file update
Update the read me file and add the dependancies
I need the read me file in a format where i can do copy past
then send me the pormpts.txt file with title for each prompt I sent
